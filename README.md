# Undergraduate-Project-Pedicting-Economic-Recessions

This was an undergraduate project that I did for a course called Senior Seminar in Applied Math. This was the final capstone project for my Bachelor's degree. This project examined how certain economic indicators influence the probability of recession using a Probit regression model. A summary of findings was presented to the Fitchburg State Mathematics department. All files including the R code, paper, as well as the presentation can be found in this repository.
