abstract={We use a machine-learning approach known as boosted regression trees (BRT) to reexamine the usefulness of selected leading indicators for predicting recessions. We estimate the BRT approach on German data and study the relative importance of the indicators and their marginal effects on the probability of a recession. Our results show that measures of the short-term interest rate and the term spread are important leading indicators. The recession probability is a nonlinear function of these leading indicators. The BRT approach also helps to uncover the way in which the recession probability depends on the interactions between the leading indicators. While the predictive power of the short-term interest rates has declined over time, the term spread and the stock market have gained in importance. The BRT approach shows a better out-of-sample performance than popular probit approaches.},

title={The yield curve as a leading indicator: some practical issues},
journal={Current Issues in Economics and Finance},
number={125},
abstract={Since the 1980s, economists have argued that the slope of the yield curve-the spread between long- and short-term interest rates-is a good predictor of future economic activity. While much of the existing research has documented how consistently movements in the curve have signaled past recessions, considerably less attention has been paid to the use of the yield curve as a forecasting tool in real time. This analysis seeks to fill that gap by offering practical guidelines on how best to construct the yield curve indicator and to interpret the measure in real time.},

title={Predicting recessions in the U.S. with yield curve spread},
abstract={This paper proposes a hidden Markov model for the signal of U.S. recessions. The model uses the spread of interest rate between 10-year Treasury bond and 3-month Treasury bill, together with other financial indicators which are the real M2 growth, the change in the Standard and Poor's 500 index of stock prices, and difference between the 6-month commercial paper and 6-month Treasury bill rates as predictors. The hidden Markov model considers temporal dependence between the recession signals and provides an estimate of the long-term probability of recessions. The empirical results indicate the hidden Markov model well predict the signal of recessions in the U.S.},

title={The yield curve and predicting recessions},
abstract={The slope of the Treasury yield curve has often been cited as a leading economic indicator, with inversion of the curve being thought of as a harbinger of a recession. In this paper, I consider a number of probit models using the yield curve to forecast recessions. Models that use both the level of the federal funds rate and the term spread give better in-sample fit, and better out-of-sample predictive performance, than models with the term spread alone. There is some evidence that controlling for a term premium proxy as well may also help. I discuss the implications of the current shape of the yield curve in the light of these results, and report results of some tests for structural stability and an evaluation of out-of-sample predictive performance.},

title={BOOSTING RECESSIONS},
abstract={Abstract
This paper explores the e ectiveness of boosting, often regarded as the state of the art classi cation tool, in giving warning signals of recessions three, six and twelve months ahead. Boosting is used to screen as many as 1500 potentially relevant predictors consisting of 132 real and nancial time series and their lags. Estimation over the full sample 1961:1-2011:12 nds that there are fewer than ten important predictors and the identity of these variables change with the forecast horizon. There is a distinct di erence in the size and composition of the relevant predictor set before and after mid-1980. Rolling window estimation reveals that the importance of the term and default spreads are recession speci c. The Aaa spread is the most robust predictor of recessions three and six months ahead, while the risky bond and 5yr spreads are important for twelve months ahead predictions. Certain employment variables have predictive power for the two most recent recessions when the interest rate spreads were uninformative. Warning signals for the post 1990 recessions have been sporadic and easy to miss. The results underscore the challenge that changing characteristics of business cycles pose for predicting recessions.},

journal={Psychonomic Bulletin \& Review},
volume={11},
number={1},
pages={192-196},
abstract={The Akaike information criterion (AIC; Akaike, 1973) is a popular method for comparing the adequacy of multiple, possibly nonnested models. Current practice in cognitive psychology is to accept a single model on the basis of only the “raw” AIC values, making it difficult to unambiguously interpret the observed AIC differences in terms of a continuous measure such as probability. Here we demonstrate that AIC values can be easily transformed to so-called Akaike weights (e.g., Akaike, 1978, 1979; Bozdogan, 1987; Burnham \& Anderson, 2002), which can be directly interpreted as conditional probabilities for each model. We show by example how these Akaike weights can greatly facilitate the interpretation of the results of AIC model comparison procedures.},
